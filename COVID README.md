# Covid-19 EDA

The focus of this project is to do an overview and data analysis on COVID-19 to determine the number of death and mortality rates that it's affected the number of states and territories of the India in terms of epidemic/pandemic, data processing, and knowledge extraction.

The Dataset contains the following columns such as Sno,Date,Time,State/UnionTerritory,ConfirmedIndianNational,	ConfirmedForeignNational,Cured,Deaths,Confirmed. 

Exploratory Data Analysis on COVID-19 Dataset
An EDA performed by Japeth Newton

# Overview
In this Jupyter notebook, we will perform EDA on the Corona Virus dataset which contains datewise entries of 188 countries, specifying their latitude, longitude, type of cases and the number of cases recorded on that day. The dataset has entries from 22nd January 2020 to 27th July 2020.

# Analysis
From this EDA, we can answer questions like:-

1. Which are the 5 most affected states in India?
2. Top 10 states with max active cases?
3. Top 10 states with max deaths?
4. Top 10 states with highest mortality rates?
5. Which date of every month recorded the highest number of cases in the world?
6. Most vaccinated States?

# Data Visualization
The graphs are also plotted for data visualization, using the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries.

# Requirements
1. Python  or higher
2. Jupyter Notebook pip install notebook
3. Pandas pip install pandas
4. Numpy pip install numpy
5. Seaborn pip intall seaborn
6. Matplotlib pip install matplotlib

# Conclusion
Exploratory Data Analysis is performed on the dataset.

Based on this  project we could  compare and check the maximum active cases, max death, and mortality rates of COVID-19 .

On deep data processing we were able to explore and visualize the number of vaccinated states and territories in India that depends on the epidemic/pandemic that affected by COVID -19.
